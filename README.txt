1. This tutorial explains the basics of the this keyword.

2. The tutorials also explains how to use the call, apply and bind methods to explicitly set the value of the this keyword

3. This tutorial also explains how the context of the this keyword is lost when used inside an asynchronous function where over time,
the this usually gets set to the global oject, in case of the browser, this is the window object

Call :
We saw how to use the call() method to dry up the code

apply:
Apply works the same as the call() method except, we pass the arguments as part of an array object

bind:
We saw how the bind() method helps us to not only explicitly set the value of the this keyword but also one can
use the function at a later date. Especially helpful when working with asynchronous functions

P.S. Check the code examples for more details
